My small VPS which I keep for my needs only (don't trust Google with your mails!) kept blowing up when I moved mails to spam and the training kicked in. So I simply whipped this together to decouple the moving from the training, and train one at a time sequentially. Now the kernel doesn't kill mysql anymore. Yippie Ki Yeay Motherfuckers!
